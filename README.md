# Skills-in-Literacy Adjusted Human Capital Dataset (SLAMYS)

This repository contains the **code and input data** for the estimation of the *Skills-in-Literacy Adjusted Mean Years of Schooling (SLAMYS)* indicator.  

SLAMYS integrates educational attainment (mean years of schooling) with literacy skills, producing a globally comparable measure of human capital for **185 countries, in five-year intervals from 1970 to 2025**, disaggregated by gender and age group (20‚Äì39 and 40‚Äì64 years).  

Building on the work of [Lutz et al. (2021, *PNAS*)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015826118)‚Äîwhich introduced the SLAMYS indicator and provided a consistent global dataset for 1970‚Äì2015‚Äîthis study extends the dataset to 2025 and adds disaggregation by gender and broad age groups, enabling more nuanced analyses of gender-specific trends and generational shifts in skill formation.  
This extension goes beyond a simple update by using broader and more recent data sources that capture both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of human capital. It incorporates new literacy data from the second cycle of the OECD‚Äôs Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) and expands empirical data coverage for the Global South through additional waves of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and, for the first time, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).
